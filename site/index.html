  <h1 align="center">Ethereal binary with H.323 support</h1>
  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>
   This project was done by me from February to June 2000 at Philips Business 
   Communications in Hilversum. They asked me to create a network sniffer 
   which could decode H.323 traffic. I changed the Q.931 dissector which 
   was already used in Ethereal, I also changed the existing RTP and RTCP 
   (RFC 1889) dissectors to suit my needs. I changed an existing ASN.1 
   compiler from the OpenH323 project to generate source to be used in 
   Ethereal. 
  </p>
  <p>
   At this site you can download Ethereal in two varieties. The source is 
   available for those that run Linux or for those running Windows who want to 
   know how it all works. For those who want to download a binary, I have only 
   got a Windows version available.
  </p>
  <h2>News</h2>

   The faststart and H.245 tunneling capability has been improved. In Help/About 
   you can now see that this version of Ethereal supports H.323. No source 
   update (yet). A collegue of mine has created an Installshield setup. (hi Hans!) 
  </p>
  <p>
   6-7-01<br>
   The H.323 capable Ethereal now supports Faststart and H.245 tunneling. No 
   upgrade to Ethereal 0.8.18 yet. The source you can download at this site 
   has NOT been updated. I will have to really spend some time making a working 
   Linux source, because at the moment it doesn't work. Windows version should 
   still work.
  </p>
  <p>
   9-4-01<br>
   The H.323 version of Ethereal is now also available for Linux! Go to the 
   source page and find out how to get it to work. There was also an 
   embarassing spelling mistake I removed (did I just make one?)
  </p>
  <p>

   I think I have nailed the one big issue my H.323 dissector had. The problem was that 
   not all Call Signalling related trafiic was going to / from port 1720. When I wrote 
   the dissector last year, I had no idea that a lot of people would run into this 
   problem. I think I have now solved it using a heuristic dissector. It should solve all 
   problems related to capturing direct endpoint to endpoint traffic and traffic to some 
   gateways.

   Wow, within a day another release.... I have found a small TPKT/Q.931 problem and I have 
   updated the website. I have not updated the executable yet, because uploading >3 
   megabyte each evening costs me too much money, so I'll have to do it from work.
  </p>
  <p>
   13-1-01<br>
   Finally, a new version! This solves no big issues, but the source is now for Ethereal 
   version 0.8.15. As always, there's an executable to download and I have also made 
   available Tethereal, which is the textmode variant of Ethereal. This site has also changed
   a little, the zip files are in a different place and the compile instructions have 
   changed.
  </p>
  <p>
   26-9-00<br>
   Another new version of the executable, this solves ANOTHER Q.931 / TPKT related bug.
   This version should also support Gatekeeper discovery (GRQ) using multicast.
  </p>
  <p>
   20-9-00<br>
   There's a new version of the executable available for download. There was a bug in 
   the TPKT handling by the Q.931 dissector. This release also fixes another TPKT bug
   I fixed earlier, where the TPKT header was sometimes displayed twice.
  </p>
  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>
   Download the <a href="bin/ethereal.exe">Win32 executable</a> (0.9 megabyte).<br>
   Don't download this file if you want to run this version of Ethereal for 
   the first time, use the link below.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Download the <a href="bin/setup.exe">InstallShield Setup</a> (3.5 megabyte).<br>
   This will install the required DLL's and will also try to install the WinPCAP
   drivers which enable you to capture network traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Linux users go to the source page.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="source/index.html">The source</a> is also available.
  </p>
  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>
   At the moment, none!
