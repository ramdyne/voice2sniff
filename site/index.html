  <h1 align="center">H.323 plugin for Ethereal</h1>
  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>
   This project started in February 2000, when I started to work for
   <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://www.sopho.philips.com/">Philips Business Communications</a> in Hilversum,
   the Netherlands. They asked me to create a network sniffer which was able to decode
   H.323 traffic, while I was getting practical experience for my study,
   <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://www.engineering.tech.nhl.nl/hi/">Computer Science</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   After some objective multiple criteria analysis (yeah, right), I decided to
   focus on <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://www.ethereal.com/">Ethereal</a> and
   <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://www.openh323.org/">OpenH323</a>. I changed the existing Q.931
   dissector which was already used in Ethereal, then I also changed (well, rewrote)
   the existing RTP and RTCP (RFC 1889) dissectors to suit my needs. I changed the
   existing ASN.1 compiler from the OpenH323 project to generate source to be used in
   an Ethereal dissector. Since March 2002 the H.323 support is supplied as a plugin
   for Ethereal instead of a binary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since March 2002, this project is available on Sourceforge. If you'd like to have
   more information, checkout the <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/projects/ethereal-h323-p/">Sourceforge</a> site.

  <h2>News</h2>
  <p>
   10-06-02<br>
   I have received some bug reports:
   <ul>
    <li>Using the current plugin (0.0.3b) with Ethereal 0.9.4 will result in a console 
     window opening showing <code>file proto.c: line 1061: assertion failed: &lt;hfinfo->type == FT_IPv4&gt;</code>, 
     and Ethereal terminating with a "Runtime Error!"<br>
     <em>The current plugin is NOT useable with Ethereal 0.9.4, use Ethereal 0.9.3. When I have time, I 
     will release a new binary version of the plugin with Ethereal 0.9.4 support. If you have access 
     to MS Visual Studio, you can compile the source yourself. It will work without any changes, just 
     follow the instructions.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
     Some people report that when Ethereal is loading a capture file whith the plugin installed it can 
     crash.<br>
     <em>Instead of installing ethereal-setup-0.9.3.exe, install ethereal-setup-0.9.3-1.exe. This will make 
      your problem go away.</em>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   19-04-02<br>
   I have removed the old news, it was confusing some people, because sometimes I did
   have Linux support and other times I didn't. People were requesting it when I already
   had it and wanted to download it when I didn't. <br>
   I added a new preface and moved the CallFlow download also to Sourceforge. I didn't
   create a new project for it, because it is very close to the plugin. I also added
   icotoprc, which has nothing to do with the plugin itself, it's just a quick hack
   for some problem I had, and to make it available to everyone I quickly hacked it
   together as a release in this project ;-)
  </p>
  <p>
   25-03-02<br>
   I have created a <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/projects/ethereal-h323-p/">project</a>
   at <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>. Now you can subscribe to
   <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=49311">mailinglists</a>,
   <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49311">submit bugs</a> and
   <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49311">download</a>
   from Sourceforge. The website will remain at voice2sniff.
  </p>
  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>
   The <a href="/web/20020727150934/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49311">downloads</a>
   for the Ethereal plugin are now hosted by Sourceforge.
  </p>
  <h2>CallFlow</h2>
  <p>
   I have created <a href="callflow/index.html">a new tool</a>. You can create message flows for H.323 with it, so you
   don't have to spend an afternoon drawing them yourself ;-)
  </p>
