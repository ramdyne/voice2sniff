  <h1 align="center">Ethereal binary with H.323 support</h1>
  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>
   This project was done by me from February to June 2000 at Philips Business 
   Communications in Hilversum. They asked me to create a network sniffer 
   which could decode H.323 traffic. I changed the Q.931 dissector which 
   was already used in Ethereal, I also changed the existing RTP and RTCP 
   (RFC 1889) dissectors to suit my needs. I changed an existing ASN.1 
   compiler from the OpenH323 project to generate source to be used in 
   Ethereal. I graduated on this project with very high grade and received my 
   diploma :-).
  </p>
  <p>
   The executable that can be downloaded from this page is capable of decoding H.323
   (Voice over IP standard) messages. Unfortunately, due to linking problems, currently I 
   can't get it to work on Linux or any other *nix.
  </p>
  <h2>News</h2>
  <p>
   15-1-01<br>
   I think I have nailed the one big issue my H.323 dissector had. The problem was that 
   not all Call Signalling related trafiic was going to / from port 1720. When I wrote 
   the dissector last year, I had no idea that a lot of people would run into this 
   problem. I think I have now solved it using a heuristic dissector. It should solve all 
   problems related to capturing direct endpoint to endpoint traffic and traffic to some 
   gateways.
  </p>
  <p>
   13-1-01<br>
   Wow, within a day another release.... I have found a small TPKT/Q.931 problem and I have 
   updated the website. I have not updated the executable yet, because uploading >3 
   megabyte each evening costs me too much money, so I'll have to do it from work.
  </p>
  <p>
   13-1-01<br>
   Finally, a new version! This solves no big issues, but the source is now for Ethereal 
   version 0.8.15. As always, there's an executable to download and I have also made 
   available Tethereal, which is the textmode variant of Ethereal. This site has also changed
   a little, the zip files are in a different place and the compile instructions have 
   changed.
  </p>
  <p>
   26-9-00<br>
   Another new version of the executable, this solves ANOTHER Q.931 / TPKT related bug.
   This version should also support Gatekeeper discovery (GRQ) using multicast.
  </p>
  <p>
   20-9-00<br>
   There's a new version of the executable available for download. There was a bug in 
   the TPKT handling by the Q.931 dissector. This release also fixes another TPKT bug
   I fixed earlier, where the TPKT header was sometimes displayed twice.
  </p>
  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>
   Download the <a href="bin/ethereal.zip">Win32 executable</a> (1.3 megabyte) or the 
   <a href="bin/tethereal.zip">textmode</a> variant.<br>
   You'll also need the <a href="bin/glib_gtk.zip">GTK for windows</a> DLL's (1.1 megabyte).<br>
   <br>
   To get Ethereal working, see the <a href="/web/20010406001041/http://www.ethereal.com/distribution/win32/win32-README.txt">instructions</a> on the Ethereal site.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want to capture with Ethereal, you'll also need to install a 
   <a href="/web/20010406001041/http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap/">packet driver</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="source/index.html">The source</a> is also available.
  </p>
  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>
   The biggest issue that I know of has to do with an unfortunate part of the protocol, random 
   ports. It is possible to not only see H.245 traffic going from/to random ports, but 
   also H.225.0 Call Signalling traffic. I have seen this behaviour with gateways, but 
   others have also seen this with terminals. There's no easy solution, but I'm working on 
   it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Update!<br>
   I think I have nailed it.
