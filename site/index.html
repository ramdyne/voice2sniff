  <h1 align="center">H.323 for Ethereal</h1>
  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>
   This project was done by me from February to June 2000 at Philips Business
   Communications in Hilversum. They asked me to create a network sniffer
   which could decode H.323 traffic. I changed the Q.931 dissector which
   was already used in Ethereal, I also changed the existing RTP and RTCP
   (RFC 1889) dissectors to suit my needs. I changed an existing ASN.1
   compiler from the OpenH323 project to generate source to be used in
   Ethereal. Since March 2002 the H.323 is supplied as a plugin for Ethereal
   in stead of a binary.

   25-03-02<br>
   I have created a <a href="/web/20020401232422/http://sourceforge.net/projects/ethereal-h323-p/">project</a>
   at <a href="/web/20020401232422/http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>. Now you can subscribe to
   <a href="/web/20020401232422/http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=49311">mailinglists</a>,
   <a href="/web/20020401232422/http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49311">submit bugs</a> and
   <a href="/web/20020401232422/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49311">download</a>
   from Sourceforge. The website will remain at voice2sniff.
  </p>
   <p>

   New version of the source! The Windows executable and the source are now back
   in-sync. I don't want to know how long it took me....
  </p>
  <p>
   31-01-02<br>
   Changed the pages a little, added a patch for Unix, now the source should
   build more easily. Also changed the Unix build instructions, forgot that
   the tarball has one subdir to many... As far as I know the source will
   now compile on Linux and Solaris.
  </p>
  <p>
   28-01-02<br>
   A couple of weeks ago I already announced on OpenH323 that I have a new
   <a href="callflow/index.html">tool</a>, but I didn't add a very clear link on it from this page. So I
   thought I'd do it now
  </p>
  <p>
   14-08-01<br>
   The faststart and H.245 tunneling capability has been improved. In Help/About
   you can now see that this version of Ethereal supports H.323. No source
   update (yet). A collegue of mine has created an Installshield setup. (hi Hans!)
  </p>
  <p>
   6-07-01<br>
   The H.323 capable Ethereal now supports Faststart and H.245 tunneling. No
   upgrade to Ethereal 0.8.18 yet. The source you can download at this site
   has NOT been updated. I will have to really spend some time making a working
   Linux source, because at the moment it doesn't work. Windows version should
   still work.
  </p>
  <p>
   9-04-01<br>
   The H.323 version of Ethereal is now also available for Linux! Go to the
   source page and find out how to get it to work. There was also an
   embarassing spelling mistake I removed (did I just make one?)
  </p>
  <p>
   15-01-01<br>
   I think I have nailed the one big issue my H.323 dissector had. The problem was that
   not all Call Signalling related trafiic was going to / from port 1720. When I wrote
   the dissector last year, I had no idea that a lot of people would run into this
   problem. I think I have now solved it using a heuristic dissector. It should solve all
   problems related to capturing direct endpoint to endpoint traffic and traffic to some
   gateways.

   Wow, within a day another release.... I have found a small TPKT/Q.931 problem and I have
   updated the website. I have not updated the executable yet, because uploading >3
   megabyte each evening costs me too much money, so I'll have to do it from work.
  </p>
  <p>
   13-01-01<br>
   Finally, a new version! This solves no big issues, but the source is now for Ethereal
   version 0.8.15. As always, there's an executable to download and I have also made
   available Tethereal, which is the textmode variant of Ethereal. This site has also changed
   a little, the zip files are in a different place and the compile instructions have
   changed.
  </p>
  <p>
   26-09-00<br>
   Another new version of the executable, this solves ANOTHER Q.931 / TPKT related bug.
   This version should also support Gatekeeper discovery (GRQ) using multicast.
  </p>
  <p>
   20-09-00<br>
   There's a new version of the executable available for download. There was a bug in
   the TPKT handling by the Q.931 dissector. This release also fixes another TPKT bug
   I fixed earlier, where the TPKT header was sometimes displayed twice.
  </p>
  <h2>Download</h2>
  <p>
   The <a href="/web/20020401232422/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=49311">downloads</a>
   for the Ethereal plugin are now hosted by Sourceforge.
  </p>
  <h2>CallFlow</h2>
  <p>
   I have created <a href="callflow/index.html">a new tool</a>. You can create message flows for H.323 with it, so you
   don't have to spend an afternoon drawing them yourself ;-)
  </p>
  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>
   At the moment, none!
